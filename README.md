This is the code used for Collexion's AI Demo, as of 5/8/17 it is not complete.

It is a simple application that allows the user to plug in image URL's into the input box and then send it through IBM Watson's Visual Recognition. Since this demo is specific to certain items, the code's logic reflects that. However, it is not difficult to modify this code for your own purpose if you choose to use it.

The python script that is used to train the Visual Recognition V3 network is not specific to this project, just plug in your api key and uncomment out the lines that you want to use. To actually train this you need to install the following library:

watson_developer_cloud

You can simply pip install it if you wish.
